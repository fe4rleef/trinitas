    <h1>Trinitas baseball needs <strong>YOUR</strong> help!</h1>

    <p>As the misrepresented team we are, we need people to help us succeed in our goals, like winning the final four
        and taking the championship by storm. Now, we can't accept anyone this year, but next year, we need all your
        help. This year, as of now, we are at a 1-4 losing streak. Not nice, right? Well, with the amount of 6th and 7th
        graders who haven't signed up, we could be doing much better. More people means more opportunites to find gems.
        We only have 11 people, which isnt the best amount of people to have on a baseball team. This could change,
        though. As a baseball player and student myself, I urge you to at least think of trying out. If it's not for
        you, don't play. But if this is what you want to do, please, dont hesitate to try out next year. Come out and
        support us. We practice hard, but we get little to no spectators. If you could, come out and support the team.
        It really means a lot to us.</p>
